# Welcome to CryptoLife

This project was made by Tom√°s Salvatore on Coderhouse's ReactJS course.

## The future is now!

Get all you need for your daily life with Cryptocurrency! This is an ecommerce where you can buy everything you want!

## Project

Created using react-create-app, also used Bootstrap and Firebase

## Components

Followed Coderhouse's instructions for creating the components and their names. Used react-router-dom v6 to connect and link them.
Firebase was used to create a database where I created items that would be displayed onscreen by fetching them through different methods, such as by category, by Id, etc.

## Bootstrap

Linked Bootstrap on the index.html and used it for all the styling of the page, while also adding minimal changes by myself.

## Video

There is a video in the repository that show the usability of the page, as of now it doesn't process the buys (as it is not connected to the firebase database to create a new colection) but the user will have no problem with that. It is responsive.
